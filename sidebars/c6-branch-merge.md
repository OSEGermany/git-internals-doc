#### Branching and Merging Screencast

In this screencast, we take you through a workflow where we branch, stash and merge several times. It demonstrates the `branch` and `show-branch` commands, how to switch branches, how to stash changes, how to list and apply stashes, how to resolve conflicts, how to create and delete topic branches, and what fast-forward merges are.
